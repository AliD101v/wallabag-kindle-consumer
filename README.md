# Push tagged wallabag articles to kindle

**This project is Work in progress!**

This is a service that polls a [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/en) instance for
articles with a certain tag (`kindle`, `kindle-mobi` or `kindle-pdf`). If it
finds an article tagged with one of thse tags, it exports the article in the
requested format and sends it via email to a configured kindle adress.
